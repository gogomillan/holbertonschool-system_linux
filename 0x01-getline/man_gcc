The Swing


BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

NAME
How do you like to go up in a swing, 
       gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler
       cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output
   Up in the air so blue? 


Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing 
SYNOPSIS
SYNOPSIS
   Ever a child can do! 
       gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard]
       cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

           [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel]

Up in the air and over the wall, 
           [-Wwarn...] [-Wpedantic]
DESCRIPTION
   Till I can see so wide, 
           [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]
       Concatenate FILE(s), or standard input, to standard output.
Rivers and trees and cattle and all 
           [-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro]

   Over the countryside- 
           [-foption...] [-mmachine-option...]
       -A, --show-all

           [-o outfile] [@file] infile...
              equivalent to -vET
Till I look down on the garden green, 


   Down on the roof so brown- 
       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.
       -b, --number-nonblank
Up in the air I go flying again, 
       g++ accepts mostly the same options as gcc.
              number nonempty output lines, overrides -n
   Up in the air and down!


DESCRIPTION
       -e     equivalent to -vE
       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly

       and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an
       -E, --show-ends
       intermediate stage.  For example, the -c option says not to run the
              display $ at end of each line
       linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.


       -n, --number
       Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
              number all output lines
       control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
